A literature review discusses published information in a particular subject area. The focus of a literature review is to summarize and synthesize the arguments and ideas of others. Literature reviews are written occasionally in the humanities, but mostly in the sciences and social sciences. If your assignment is not very specific, seek clarification from your instructor. Look for other literature reviews in your area of interest or in the discipline. There are hundreds or even thousands of articles and books on most areas of study. Cultural studies scholars are accepting popular media as a subject worthy of academic consideration. A literature review must contain at least three basic elements: an introduction or background information section, the body of the review containing the discussion of sources, and a conclusion and/or recommendations section. There are a few guidelines you should follow during the writing stage as well. A literature review in this sense is just like any other academic research paper. Your interpretation of the available sources must be backed up with evidence to show that what you are saying is valid. While the literature review presents others’ ideas, your voice (the writer’s) should remain front and center. Be sure to use terminology familiar to your audience; get rid of unnecessary jargon or slang. Double check that you’ve documented your sources and formatted the review appropriately for your discipline. This work is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.
