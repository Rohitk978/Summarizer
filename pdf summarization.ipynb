The book is one of the most inspiring books on wealth ever written. \"A wonderful, refreshing read for even the most experienced investor\" —Los Angeles Times. \"The law of money is universal and unchanging. May they prove to be for you, as they have proven to so many others\" Penguin Books is an imprint of New American Library, a division of Penguin Putnam Inc. Previously published in a Dutton edition. This book is stolen property. It was reported as \"unsold and destroyed\" to the publisher. Neither the author nor the publisher has received any payment for this \"stripped book\" This book of cures for lean purses has been termed a guide to financial understanding. Success means accomplishments as the result of our own efforts and abilities. Our acts can be no more successful than our thoughts. Babylon became the wealthiest city of the ancient world because its citizens were the richest people of their time. They appreciated the value of money. They practiced sound financial principles in acquiring and keeping money. 2THERICHEST MAN IN BABYLON. The story of a man who became the richest man in Babylon. He was the son of a king and the son-in-law of the king's son. Behind him, had he cared to turn and look, the noisy chariots of the rich jostled and crowded aside sandaled tradesmen as well as the barefootedbeggars. Even the rich were forced to turn into the gutters to clear the way for the long lines of slave water carriers, on the \"king's business\" Bansir asked Kobbi to lend him two shekels. Kobbi asked why he had no money. Bansir replied: \"No one lends his entire fortune, not even to his best friend\" Kobbi had a dream in which he thought he was a man of means. When he awoke he realized how empty was his purse. Kobbi's wife was again the smiling maiden of their early married days. The Man Who Desired Gold is the story of a man who longs for wealth. The story is told from the point of view of a young man. \"Consider, also, our sons,\" Bansir conti nued, \"are they not following in the footsteps of their fathers?\" \"Never, in all the years of our friendship, didst                thou talk like this before, Bansir.\" Kobbi asked: \"Why cannot we have our just share of the good things so plentiful for those who have the gold with which to buy them?\" \"Would I know an answer!\" Kobbi replied. \"No                better than thou am I satisfied!\" Kobbi indicated the wearer of the bell who marched                in front without a load. \"A prominent man in his                own country, 'tis easy to see:\" Bansir and Kobbi are seeking to find out how others acquire gold and do as they do. \"Perhaps there is some secret we might learn if we                but sought from those who knew,\" replied Bansir. \"I did pass our                old friend, Arkad, riding in his golden chariot. He did not look over my humble head as many in his station might consider his right,\" replied Kobbi. The Man Who Desired Gold 8/8/08. \"Income, that is the thing,\" ejaculated Bansir. \"I want an income that will keep flowing into my purse whether I sit upon the wall\" Bansir: \"I strove to become a skilful lyre player. And, at itI did succeed. The Gods were content to let us continue thus. Now, at last, we see a light, like the rising sun\" The Richest Man in Babylon was a man named Arkad. He was famed for his great wealth and his liberality. But his friends told him he was more fortunate than they were. 'Fickle Fate' is a vicious goddess who brings noipientpermanent good to anyone. She makes wanton spenders, who soon dissipate all they receive. Yet others whom she favours become misers and hoard their wealth, fearing tospend what they have. \"Wealth is a power. With wealth many things are possible,\" he said. His friends admitted that of the men they knew who had inherited wealth these words were true. \"I would not be one of those who stand afar off,enviously watching others enjoy,\" he said. \"I would make myself a guest at this banquet of good things\" The Richest Man in Babylon 13                that learning was of two kinds: the one kind being the things we learned and knew, and the other being the training that taught us how to find out what we did not know. 14THERICHEST MAN IN BABYLON recounted the story of how he became rich. He was offered two coppers if he completed a task in two days. He refused the offer and spent all night carving the clay tablets. \"You have fulfilled your part of our bargain, and I am ready to tell you the rest of the story\" \"The sun that shines today is the sun that shone when thy father was born, and will still be shining when thy last grandchild shall pass\" The Richest Man in Babylon tells the story of how he became the richest man in Babylon. He tells how he decided that a part of all he earned was mine to keep. 'That was sufficient to change the heart of asheep herder into the hearts of a money lender,' he says. \"Wealth, like a tree, grows from a tiny seed. The first copper you save is the seed from which your wealthiertree grows\" \"A part of all you earn is yours to keep. It should be not less than a tenth no matter how little you earn\" \"I thought much about what he had said to me, and it seemed reasonable. So I decided that I would purposefullytry it,\" he said. The Richest Man in Babylon 17:17-17: \"Every fool mus t learn,\" he growled, 'but why trust the knowledge of a brick maker about jewels?\" \"I again saved each tenth copper, for I now hadformed the habit and it was no longer difficult\" \"I do have a great feast with honey and fine wine and spiced cake\" \"Some day I shall buy me a young assupon which to ride\" \"Arkad,\" he continued, 'you have learned your Lessons well. You first learned to live upon less than you could earn. Next you learned to seek advice from those who were competent. And, lastly, you have l earned to make gold work for you\" The Richest Man in Babylon tells how he became an heir to his father-in-law's wealth. Arkad was so successful that he was able to share in his father's estate as he had arranged. \"Willpower!\" retorted Arkad. \"What nonsense. Do you think willpower gives a man the strength to lift                a burden the camel cannot ca rry?\" \"I am careful not to start difficult and impractical tasks, because I loveleisure,\" says Arkad. \"When I set a task for myself, I complete it,\" he adds. \"A part of all I earn is mine to keep,\" Algamish said. Wealth grows in magic ways. No man can prophesy the limit of it. The Richest Man in Babylon 21 percent of his earnings will be his own. He will be numbered among the greatest men in the world. \"Make it your slave\" \"Counsel with wise men. Seek the advice of men whose daily work is handling money. Let them saveyou from such an error as I myself made in en -                trusting my money to the judgment of Azmur\" \"Enjoy life while you are here.

But some had in their eyes. a new light. They realized that Algamish had come. back each time to the room of the scribes because he. was watchi ng a man work his way out of darkness                into light. Babylon was once one of the richest cities in the world. But the people of Babylon had to learn how to become wealthy. They first had to find a way to make money. \"Who knows best in all our city how to becomewealthy?\" asked the king. \"Quite possible, your Excellency,\" replied the Chancellor. \"But who canteach them? Certainly not the priests.\" Seven Cures for a Lean Purse 24. The King of Babylon. He is the richest man in Babylon. Bring him before me on the morrow. The next day, he appears before him. The king's eyes glowed. \"Arkad, thou speaketh the words I wish to hear. Wilt thou lend thyself to this                great cause?\" \"Whatever knowledge I possess will I                gladly give for the betterment of my fellowmen\" Arkad sat beside a small taboret upon which smoked a sacred lamp. He began to explain how he came to be the richest man in Babylon. \"I started my fortune in the humblest way,\" he said. Each day for seven days will I explain to you one of the seven remedies. Discuss it among yourselves. First must each of you start wisely to build a fortune of his own. Then wilt thou be competent, and only then, to teach these truths to others.

Arkad turned to the class with a smile. \"Does any man here have a lean purse?\" The class looked amused, then they laughed, then waved their purses in jest. 28THERICHEST MAN IN BABYLON: \"I told thee I would tell how                I built my fortune. This was my beginning. I, too, carried a lean purse and cursed it because there was nothing within to satisfy my desires\" Arkadu: For each ten coins I put in,                to spend but nine.' Debate this among yourselves. If any man proves it untrue, tell me upon the morrow when we shall meet again. \"Confuse not the necessary expense s with thy de -sires. Each of you, together with your good families, have more desires than your earnings can gratify\" \"Study thoughtfully thy accustomed habits of liv - tumultuousing. Herein may be most often found certain accepted acceptedexpenses that may wisely be reduced or eliminated\" \"Let thy motto be one hundred per cent of appreciated value demanded for each coin spent\" \"I feel it would take much plea - sure from my life and make me little more than a pack-ass to carry a burden,\" said Arkad. \"I would make it for myself,\" responded the pro - vehementlytesting one. Budget thy expenses so that thou mayest have coins to pay for thy necessities, and for enjoyments, without spending more than nine -                tenths of thy earnings. Third cure is to make thy gold multiply. \"I tell you, my students, a man's wealth is not in. the coins he carries in his purse; it is the income he. buildeth, the golden stream that continually floweth. into his purse and keepeth it always bulging. That is what every man desireth\" \"Behold, from my humble earnin gs I had begotten a hoard of golden slaves, each labouring and earning more gold\" Seven Cures for a Lean Purse. \"When the boy had reached the age of twenty years, the farmer again went to the money lender to inquire about the silver. \"Because the son did not need the coins, he left them with the money lenders. Gold in a man's purse must be guarded with firmness, else it be lost. Is it wise to be intrigued by larger                earnings when thy principal may be lost? I say not. Study carefully, Study carefully before parting with thy treasure. \"My own first investment was a tragedy to me at the time. The guarded savings of a year I did entrustto a brickmaker, named Azmur, who was travelling over the far seas\" Seven Cures for a Lean Purse.

Secure the advice of those experienced in theprofitable handling of gold. \"No man's family can fully enjoy life unless they have a plot of ground wherein children can play,\" he said. \"To a man's heart it brings gladness to eat the figs from his own trees,\" he added. \"Also I say to you, my students, that the moneyipientlenders gladly consider the desires of men who seek                homes and land for their families\" Seven Cures for a Lean Purse 37                THESIXTH CUREInsure a future income with investments or provisions.

The list includes a small amount of money to be paid to the family of a deceased relative. Arkad addressed his class upon the seventh day. He spoke of the importance of increasing one's ability to earn. He also spoke of those things that work for or against a person's success. Within him was a strong desire to earn more, aproper and commendable desire. In learning to secure his one definite small desire, he hath trained himself to secure a larger one. This is the proce ss by which wealth is accumulated. \"As a man perfecteth himself in his calling even so doth his ability to earn increase\" \"The more of wisdom we know, the more we mayearn\" \"Always do the affairs o f man change and improve,\" he said. \"I urge all men to be in the front rank of progress and not to stand still\" \"There is more gold in Babylon, my students, than you dreamest of. There is abundance for all\" \"If a man be lucky, there is no foretelling the possible                extent of his good fortune\" \"There are seven cures for a lean purse\" The desire to be lucky is universal. It was just as strong in the breasts of men four thousand years ago as it is in the hearts of men today. Is there a way to attract good luck? That is exactly what the men of ancient Babylon decided to find out. Within the Temple of Learning all men met as equals. The humblest of slaves could dispute with impunity the opinions of a prince of the royal house. Arkad was called the richest man in Babylon. Meet the Goddess, of Good Luck 45 years ago. \"I have a subject I would like to hear discussed yet hesitate to offer lest it seem ridiculous to you, Arkad, and my good friends here,\" says a weaver. \"To continue to be lucky is my great desire,\" he adds. \"What say you, my friends, shall we seek to find if there be means by which good luck may be enticed to visit each and                all of us?\" asked Arkad. \"Yea! Yea! And much of it!\" responded the grow ing ing group of eager listeners. \"We meet here to consider all sides of each question,\" brok e in Arkad. \"To ignore the,, purposefullygaming table would be to overlook an instinct com - tumultuousmon to most men\" \"Didst the goddess whisper in thy ear to bet uponMeet the Goddess, of Good Luck 47                the grays because at the last turn the inside black would stumble and so interfere with our bays?\" \"To me she is a goddess of love and dignity whose pleas ind me of the races but yesterday,\" responded another listener. \"In tilling the soil, in honest trading, in all of man's.occupations, there is opportunity to make a profit,\" he says. \"The game is so arranged that it will always favour the game keeper.\" Arkad: Few players realize how certain are the gamekeeper's profits and how uncertain are their own chances to win. \"Can a man expect to win more than occasionally against odds so arranged that he should lose one -fifth of all his bets?\" he asked. \"You who are gathered here tonight know many more of our substantial citizens,\" Arkad said. \"Yet among them I am unable to name a single one who started his success from such a source\" An elderly merchant offers a suggestion to the Arkad. He suggests that they take credit for their business success. But they should also consider the successes they almost enjoyed but didn't. \"Here is a wise approach,\" Arkad approved. \"Who                among you have had good luck within your grasp, only to see it escape?\" The Merchant raised his hand to speak. \"The son of my father's friend did not possess suf -                ficient gold to complete such an undertaking. He, therefore, decided to interest a group of men to enter the enterprise with him\" The group was to comprise twelve, each of whom must agree to pay one -tenth of his earnings.

'We live in a different age' \"In this tale we see how good luck waits to come to that man who accepts opportunity,\" commented a swar -thy man of the desert. \"To the building of an estate there must always be the beginning\" \"To take his first start to building an estate is as good luck as can come to any man,\" he says. \"Had our friend, the merchant, taken this step in his early manhood when this opportunity came to I him, this day he would be blessed with much more.\" Meet the Goddess of Good Luck 53 years after her birth. \"She will not wait for such slow fellow. She thinks if a man desires to be lucky he will step quick\" Arkad. e and bowed good -naturedly in response to the laughter. \"My admiration to thee,                stranger within our gates, who hesitates not to speak the truth,\" he said. \"I am a buyer of animals, mostly camels and horses, but sometimes I also buy the sheep and goats\" \"So dark it was that I could not see his flock, but from the bleating I did know it must be large\" The farmer declared to contain nine hundred sheep. Meet the Goddess of Good Luck, Arkad. She is the goddess of good luck and good fortune. She can grant wishes, grant wishes and grant wishes. She cannot be killed. The Syrian said: \"Good luck fled from procrastination in both these tales. Each time opportunity fly a way for same rea -                son. How can men succeed that way?\" The buyer replied: \"My first judgment is my best. Yet always have I found it difficult to com -                pel myself to proceed with a good bargain\" \"In my younger days I did not know it by this                long word our friend from Syria doth enjoy. Yet, this is not unusual. The spirit of pro -                crastination is within all men.

They were written on a clay tablet and were meant to be passed down through generations. The five laws were to be followed for ten years. The laws were intended to bring security and comforts. \"My father,' he began deferentially, 'I bow before his wisdom' 'Thou gave me liberally of thy gold. Of the gold, alas!' 'It fled, indeed, from my inexp erienced hands' 'I decided to go to Nineveh, as it was a growing burgeoning city' 'I joined a caravan and among its members made nu -                merous friends. Two well -spoken men who had a most beautiful white horse as fleet as the wind were among these.

Thou hadst sent me forth purposefullyto become a man, and this I was determined to ac -                complish' 'At this time, I beth ought me of the table thou had given to me upon which thou had carved the                five laws of gold' 66-year-old is the oldest man in the city. He was given a clay tablet by his father ten years ago. It contains the five laws of gold. 'I do proclaim them as of greater value than the gold itself, as I will show by the continuance of mytale' 'I saved a copper from my first earnings, adding to it at every opportunity u ntil I had a piece of silver. I did it grudgingly, I admit, because I was determined to earn back as much gold as you, my father, had given to me' Within a year the outer wall will be complete and ready for the great gates of bronze that will be built. In all Nineveh there is not enough metal to make these gates. A group of us will pool our resources and send a caravan to the mines of copper andtin, which are distant.

'To him who is without knowledge of the five laws, gold comes not often, and g oeth                away quickly. But to him who abide by the five Laws,                gold comes and works as his dutiful slave' Nomasir took from the slave two bags of gold and placed them before his father.

He is a friend of the king of Babylon. The king gave him 50 pieces of gold as a gift, but he is perplexed. \"Can one refuse to share with one's own sister?\" Mathon asked. \"Surely, thy own sister would not wish to deprive thee of enjoying thy r eward?\" \"Didst ever hear of the farmer of Nineveh who                could understand the language of animals?

The main ar - perceptions of the city were with their king, far away in the east on the great expedition. The defenders from the top of the wall fought off attackers with arrows, burning oil and, if any reached the top, spear s. Against the defenders, thousands of the enemy's archers poured a deadly barrage of arrows. The walls of Babylon are strong.

They are high and s trong. ust of our enemies should they break in.\" \"Be not afraid, little one,\" he reassured her. \"The walls of Babylon will protect you.\" For three weeks and five days the attack waged with scarcely ceasing violence. Each day the slaughtered attackers piled up in heaps before the wall. Each night they were carried back and buried by theircomrades. The streets were jammed with a throbbing mob. The walls of Babylon were an outstanding example of man's need and desire for protection. This desire is just as strongtoday as it ever was, but we have developed broader and better plans to accomplish the same purpose. The Camel Trader of Babylon 95                out the copper he knew all too well how unwelcome he would be. Lea ving the market, he paced back and forth in front of the eatinghouse. Perhaps here he might meet someone he                knew; someone from whom he could borrow a cop-out. Dabasir made Tarkad feel uncomfortable because of his failure to repay promptly. \"I am sorry, very sorry,\" he mumbled weak ly, \"but this day I have neither the copper nor the silver with which I could repay\" \"Surely thou canst get hold of a few coppers and a piece of silver to insanelyrepay the generosity of an old friend of thy father?\" Tarkad flinched from the brutal frankness of Da -                basir, but here at least was an invitation to enter the doorway of the eating house. When Kauskor appeared smiling, Dabasir addressed him with his usual freedom. \"I did hear from a traveller just returned from Urfaof a certain rich man who has a piece of stone cut so thin that one can look through it,\" Dabasir said. \"He put it in the window of his house to keep out the rains. It is yel-                low, so this traveller does relate, and he was per mit-                ting to look throughIt and all the outside world looked strange and not like -it really is\" \"The tale that I am about to tell,\" began Dabasir, \"relates to my early life and how I came to be a camel trader\" \"Didst anyone know that I once was a. slave in Syria?\" asked the man. \"Yes,\" said the man, \"I was a young man. I worked with my father.\" \"Being young and without experience I did not know that he who spends more than he earns is sow -ing the winds of needless self -indulgence,\" he said. \"So I indulged my whims for fine raiment and bought luxuries for my good wife and our home, beyond our means\" \"We met with success on our first trip, capturing                a rich haul of gold and silks and valuable merchan -dise. This loo t we took to Ginir and squandered. The second time we were not so fortunate. Just after we had made our capture, we were attacked by                the spearsmen of a native chief to whom the caravans paid for protection\" \"Fearful I stood, as those four women looked me over. I wondered if I could expect pity from them\" \"Of eunuchs we have plenty, but of camel tenders we have few\" \"I can make them kneel, I can load them and I can lead them on long trips without tiring,' he said. 'The slave speaks f orward enough,' observed his master. 'If thou so desire, Sira, take this man for thy Camel tender' \"For over a year I was a slave and lived with the                slaves, but I could not become as one of them. T, too, must sit apart,' she confided. 'Were I a man I would rather die than be such a slave, but the conventions of our tribe make slaves of women' The Camel Trader of Babylon 101: \"I am not a weakling,\" I denied hotly. \"Then prove it.' \" 'How?' I asked. \"Thy great king fight his enemies in every way he can and with every force he has,\" she replied. \"They ran thee out of Babylon. You left them alone and they grew too strong for thee' 'My mother is again very sick,’ she said. ‘Saddlethe two best camels in my husband's herd. Tie on water skins and saddle bags for a long journey' Three days later the maid of Sira took me to her mistress. 102THERICHEST MAN IN BABYLON                \" 'Happiness,' she responded, 'awaits not the run -away wife who seeks it in far lands among strange people' \"I needed no further urging, but thanked her warmly and was away into the night\" \"It was such a journey from then on as few men                live to tell of. Day after day we plodded along. Food and water gave out. At the end of the ninth day, I slid from the back                of my mount with the feeling that I was too weak to ever remo unt and I would surely die\" \"If I had the soul of a free man, what then?\" he asked. \"Surely I would force my way back to the people who had trusted me\" \"My debts were my enemies, but the men I owed were my f riends for they had trusted me and be -                lieved in me. Within me surged the soul of a free man going back to conquer his enemies and re -                ward his friends. I thrilled with the great resolve\" \"The soul of a free man looks at life as a series of problems to be solved and solves them\" \"I now had the determination so I set out to find a way. First I visited every man to whom I was indebted and begged his indulgence\" The Camel Trader of Babylon 105                them met me gladly. Several reviled me but others offered to help me. Gradually I was able to repay every copper and every piece of silver. Then at last I could hold up my head and feel                that I was an honourable man among men. The Clay Tablets from Babylon arrived at St. Swithin's College, Nottingham, on October 21. Professor Franklin Caldwell translated the inscriptions. The tablets arrived without damage. Dabasir is an ancient Babylonian poet who lived in the 7th century BC. He wrote a book about his time in the city of Babylon. The book is called \"The Book of Babylon\" Alfred H. Shrewsbury, Professor of Archaeology at the University of Oxford, writes to Dabasir. He has returned from slavery in Syria and is determined to pay off his debts. He also wants to set up a record of his affairs to guide him through his high desires. One -tenth of all I earn shall be set aside as my own to keep. For Mathon speaketh wiselywhen he saith: \"That man who keepeth in his purse both gold and silver that he need not spend is good to his family and loyal to his king\" Seven -tenths of all I earn shall be used to provide a home, clothes to wear, and food to eat, with a bit extra to spend. He doth further enjoin the greatest care that we spend not greater than seven -t tenths of what I earn for these worthy purposes. To these creditors do I owe in total one hundred. and ninete en pieces of silver and one hundred and. hundred and twenty-one pieces of copper. Because I did owe these metrics and saw no way to repay, in my folly I. didst leave my native city and seek easy wealth elsewhere, only to find disaster and to see myself sold into the.degradation of slavery. The Clay Tablets from Babylon 111                TABLET FOUR                Again the moon shines full. t I have no resources with which to pay. Except my ability to earn, and that I intend to apply two-tenths of all I earn upon my indebtedness evenly                and honestly. This much can I pay but no more than that. Nebatur has earned during the past moon, buying camels of sound wind and goodlegs, for Nebatur, the sum of nineteen pieces of silver. He divided the silver according to the plan. I intercepted a fine herd of camels and bought many sound ones. This moon my wife and I have bought much needed sandals and raiment. We have dined well on meat and fowl. Even Alkahad did not protest. Three times the moon had been full since I last                carved upon this clay. Each time I paid to myself                one-tenth of all I earned. I have lived upon seven -tenths ev en though at times it was difficult. Many things occurred upon my final visit to my creditors that I shall long remember. Ahmar begged my forgiveness for his unkind words and said that I                was one of all others he most desired for a friend. Many others speak deferentially to me. My wife looketh upon me with a light in her eyes that doth make a man have confidence in himself. Professor Franklin Caldwell wrote to the head of the British Scientific Expedition in Mesopotamia in 1936. He wanted to find out how to get out of debt and at the same time have gold to jingle.

It has risen out of the ruins of Babylon, just                a s t r u e a n d j u s t a s v i t a l a s t h e d a y i t w a s. The Luckiest Man in Babylon is a tale of a young man's quest for happiness. The story is based on the life of Sharru Nada, who lived in Babylon in the 12th century. Sharru Nada and Hadan Gula rode in silence until the trail led them to the slope. Here they could see the walls of Babylon and the Temple of Bel. \"Babylon is the wealthiest city in all the world,\" Hadan said. \"Why wish his spirit to linger on earth beyond its                allotted time?\" asked Sharru Nada. \"Alas, of us, neither has his gift. We would not be so sorely pressed.\" Sharru Nada looked back at his caravan, well -chosen camels and donkeys, loaded with valuable goods from Damascus. He pointed to the plowers, saying, \"Still plowing the same field where they were forty years ago\" A plan came almost in a flash. He must consider his own family and his o wnforming. It would be cruel; it would hurt. Being a man of quick decisions, he waived objections. The Luckiest Man in Babylon was once chained as a slave. Hadan Gula asked in surprise. Sharru Nada looked him squarely in the eye. \"I was the victim of my own greed,\" he said. Hadan Gula was a slave sold to a slave dealer after his brother killed his fiancee in a brawl. Hadan's father could not raise the silver to free him, so the widow sold him to the slave dealer. The slave dealer sold Hadan to the Babylonian king. \"Terror gripped me that night. It doesn't make sense to talk of masters beating willing, hard -working                slaves to death. Masters like good slaves and treat them well' The Luckiest Man in Babylon is the story of a young man who is sold to the walls of Babylon. \"I am young. I want to live. Is there any chance for me to get a good master?\" he asks Godoso. The famous works of ancient Babylon, its walls, temples, hanginggardens and great canals, were built by slave labour. This force of workmen also included many citizens of Babylon and its provinces who had been sold into slavery because of  war. \"Godoso had been right. We were taken to the slave prison and next morning marched to the pens in the market. Here the rest of the men huddled in fear and only the whips of our guard could kee\" The Luckiest Man in Babylon 127 says he felt sorry for the Pirate who was shackled and beaten by soldiers. He tells how the Pirate told him how valuable work would be to him in the future. \"Megiddo asked about his farm and crops, soon                convincing him that he would be a valuable man\" \"I was becoming desperate when a fat, good -natured man walked up to the wall and in -quired if there was a baker among us\" \"I felt like a fat ox being sold to a butcher,\" he says. \"I followed my newmaster away, thinking I was the luckiest man in                Babylon\" \"My new home was much to my liking,\" he adds. \"I felt it was time for me to think of a way by which I might start to earn c oins to buy my freedom,\" he writes. \"I presented my plan to Nana -naid this way: 'If I can use my afternoons after the baking is finished to progressivelyearn for thee coins, would it be only fair for thee to share my earnings with me?'\"'Fair enough, fair enough,' he admitted. 'Here is what we will do,' he sug - progressivelygested.\" The L uckiest Man in Babylon 129                \"I was much pleased by his generous offer that I                might keep for myself, one -fourth of my sales. That                night 1 worked late to make a tray upon which to display them\" \"As I went forth with my tray of cakes every day, I                soon found regular customers. One of these was none                other than thy grandfather, Arad Gula\" \"I was so excited over my success I could hardly sleep\" \"I was overjoyed one day to meet my friend Meg -iddo upon the street. He was leading three donkeys with vegetables to the market. 'I am doing a mighty well,' he said. 'My master does appreciate my good work' The Luckiest Man in Babylon 131                . ften I went outside the city gates to solicit theoverseers of the slaves buil ding the walls. One day I was surprised to see Zabado waiting in line to fill his basket with bricks. He was gaunt and bent, and his back was covered with welts and sores from the whips of the overseers. Sharru Nada's grandson, Hadan Gula, refused to listen to his grandfather's lies. \"I honour him for ris ing above his misfortune and becoming a leading citi zen ofDamascus,\" he said. \"The Gods indeed condoned his misfortunes and honed him with their respect,\" Sharru Nada replied. \"Act like a free man and succeed like one! Decide what you want and then work to achieve it!\" \"So dense was the crowd about the flogging post, I feared to go near lest my tray of honey cakes be upset. I was fortunate in having a view of Nebuchadnezzar himself as he rode by in hisgolden chariot\" \"I knew he was cruel and un -derstood why such inhuman tasks were demanded,\" he says. \"After the slave was dead, his body was hung atop a pole by a rope attached to his leg\" \"One evening Swasti came to me in deep distress: 'Thy master is in trouble. I fear for him' 'Why should we worry over his folly,' I replied thoughtlessly. 'We are not his keepers' \"I was whirled away from my dearest hopes as the hurricane snatches the tree from the forest andcasts it into the surging sea\" \"Picture a desert with not a tree, just low shrubs and a sun burning with such fury the water in ourbarrels became so hot we could scarcely drink it\" \"Then picture rows of men, going down into the deep meticulouslyexcavation and lugging heavy baskets of dirt\" \"At first I worked with good will, but as the                months dragged on, I felt my spirit breaking\" \"I thought of Pirate with his bitterness and won -                dered if it might be jus t as well to fight and kill\" \"Yet I was just as willing to work as Megiddo; he                could not have worked harder than I. Why did not my work bring me happiness and success?\" \"Was I destined to be ever thus punished for I                knew not what? What new miseries and disappoint -ments awaited me?\" \"When I had almost given up hope, I did meet Swasti who told me of the                money lender, who directed me to thy noble owner\" \"Tears of gratitude filled my eyes. 1 knew I was                the luckiest man in Babylon. hou will be a                free man!' So saying he drew from beneath his robe the                clay tablet carrying my title. This he raised above his                head and hurled it to break in a hundred pieces upon                the cobblestones. Sharru Nada and Hadan Gula rode in the shadowsof the towering walls up to the massive, bronze gates of Babyloa. At their approach the gate guards jumped to attention and respectfully saluted an honoured citi - counterterrorismzen. Babylon was located beside the Euphrates River, in a flat, arid valley. It had no mines, not even stone for build ing. It was not even located upon a natural trade route. Babylon possessed just two natural resources — a                fertile soil and water in the river. The rainfall was insufficient to raise crops. With one of the greatest engineering acc omplishments of this or any other day, Babylonian engineers diverted the waters by means of dams. The site of the city is in Asia about six hundred miles east of the Suez Canal, just north of the Persian Gulf. It possessed a climate similar to that of Yuma, Arizona, hot and dry. Babylon was one of the wealthiest cities of the Middle Ages. The city was built over a valley of desert dust. Archaeologists discovered the city in the 1990s. Scientists consider the civilization of Babylon and other cities in this valley to be the oldest of which there is a definite record. Positive dates have been                proved reaching back 8000 y ears. Uncovered in the ruins of Babylon were de -                scriptions of an eclipse of the sun. The remains of these canals can still be traced, although they are mostly filled with sand. Some of them were of such size that, when empty of water, a dozen horses could be ridden abreast along their bottoms. By means of an elaborate drainage system they reclaimed an immense area of swampland at the mouths of the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers. The glory of Babylon has faded but its wisdom has been preserved for us. In that distant day, the use of paper had not been invented. Instead, they engraved their writing upon tablets of moist142THERICHEST MAN IN BABYLON                . When completed, these were baked and became a hard tile. From these clay tablets we are permitted an insight into the intimate, personal affairs of the peo -                ple. One tablet, evidently from the re -cords of a country storekeeper, relates that upon the given date a certain named customer brought in a cow and exchanged it for seven sacks of wheat. King Nabopolassar started the rebuilding six hundred years before the time of Christ. The total length of the walls is estimated to be nine and eleven miles. So wide was the top that a six -horse chariot could be driven around them. Invading armies of that day were not to be considered lightly. Two or three years of preparation would be required to assemble war materials and food along the proposed line of march. Babylon was never entered by hostile armies until 540 years before the birth of Christ. The story of the fall of Babylon is most unusual. The Babylonians were clever financiers and traders. Cyrus entered the open gates of Babylon and took possession without resistance. Babylon had fallen, never to rise again, but to it civilization owes much.
